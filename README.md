# **CardioVision - Heart Disease Prediction**

## ~Project Description
CardioVision is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the risk of heart disease in individuals. By leveraging the UCI Heart Disease dataset, this project seeks to provide accurate predictions that can aid in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare.

## ~Problem Statement
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Early detection and intervention can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project addresses the challenge of predicting heart disease risk using various machine learning models.

## ~Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the UCI Heart Disease dataset, which includes 14 attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. This dataset is publicly available and widely used for heart disease prediction research.

## ~Models Used
We have employed several machine learning models to predict heart disease risk, including Logistic Regression where we have employed the Logistic Regression model to predict heart disease risk. This model is particularly effective for binary classification, distinguishing between the presence or absence of heart disease.
